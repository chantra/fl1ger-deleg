1.  Introduction

   The new delegation mechanism based on DELEG record type allows to
   specify attributes a resolver can use when talking to a delegated
   authority.  This document introduces parameters specific to different
   transport mechanism than the default udp/53 protocol.

   Legacy DNS resolvers unaware of DELEG mechanism would continue to use
   the NS and DS records, while resolvers that understand DELEG and its
   associated parameters can efficiently switch to new transports.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Terminology regarding the Domain Name System comes from [BCP219],
   with addition terms defined here:

   *  [tbd]

   *  [tbd]

1.2.  Introductory Examples

   To introduce DELEG record with DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858], this example
   shows a possible response from an authoritative in the authority
   section of the DNS response when delegating to another nameserver.

   example.com.  86400  IN DELEG  1 ns2.example.com. (
                   alpn=dot
                   tlsa="2 0 1 ABC..."
                   ipv4hint=192.0.2.54
                   ipv6hint=2001:db8:2423::3 )
   example.com.  86400  IN NS     ns1.example.com.
   ns1.example.com.    86400   IN  A  192.0.2.1
   ns1.example.com     86400   IN  AAAA    2001:DB8::1

   In this example, the authoritative nameserver is delegating using
   DNS-over-TLS.  Like in SVCB, DELEG also offer the ability to use the
   AliasMode delegation.  The example below shows an example where
   example.com is being delegated with a DELEG AliasMode record which
   can then be further resolved using standard SVCB to locate the actual
   parameters.

   example.com.  86400  IN DELEG 0   config2.example.net.
   example.com.  86400  IN NS     ns1.example.net.

   The example.net authoritative server may return the following SVCB
   records in response to a query as directed by the above records.

   config2.example.net 3600    IN SVCB ns2.example.net. (
                   alpn=dot
                   tlsa="2 0 1 ABC..."
                   ipv4hint=192.0.2.54
                   ipv6hint=2001:db8:2423::3 )

   The above records indicate to the client that the actual
   configuration for the example.com zone can be found at
   config2.example.net.

   Later sections of this document will go into more detail on the
   resolution process using these records.

1.3.  Goal of the DELEG record

   The primary goal of transport specification in DELEG records is to
   provide zone owners a way to signal to new clients how to connect to
   servers serving a child domain that can coexist with NS records in
   the same zone, and do not break software that does not support new
   transports.

1.3.1.  SvcParams

   All SvcParamKeys for the "dns" scheme [RFC9461] apply as specified.
   These are the "transport parameters", describing how to reach an
   endpoint.

   The "alpn" transport parameter is OPTIONAL to include (unlike in
   SVCB-DNS, where it is generally required).  If the "alpn" SvcParamKey
   is omitted, the only available transport is presumed to be
   unencrypted DNS over UDP/TCP port 53.  Endpoints can indicate that
   insecure transport is not available by specifying "mandatory=alpn".

   When TargetName is below the zone cut, DELEG ServiceMode records MUST
   include "ipv4hint" or "ipv6hint" SvcParamKeys.  These keys provide
   the address glue, which enables the initial connection to this
   endpoint.

   The following additional DNS SVCB parameters are defined for the
   DELEG and SVCB ServiceModes.

1.3.1.1.  "tlsa"

   The "tlsa" SvcParamKey is a transport parameter representing a TLSA
   RRset [RFC6698] to be used when connecting to TargetName using a TLS-
   based transport.  If present, this SvcParam SHOULD match the TLSA
   records whose base domain ([RFC6698], Section 3) is TargetName.  Due
   to bootstrapping concerns, this SvcParamKey has been added to the
   DELEG record as the TLSA records might only be resolveable after the
   initial connection to the delegated nameserver was established.  When
   this field is not present, certificate validation should be performed
   by either DANE or by traditional TLS certification validation using
   trusted root certification authorities.

   The SvcParamValue is a non-empty value-list.  The presentation and
   wire format of each value is the same as the presentation and wire
   format described for the TLSA record as defined in [RFC6698],
   sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively.  To avoid wasting resources in the
   parent zone, parents MAY reject RRSets containing "tlsa" SvcParams
   that use matching type 0 (exact match).

   As a special case, the presentation value "disabled", corresponding
   to an empty value in wire format, indicates that DANE MUST NOT be
   used with this record.

   To avoid a circular dependency, "tlsa" MUST appear in any DELEG
   record that is used to serve its own TargetName.

   Resolvers that support TLS-based transports MUST adopt one of the
   following behaviors:

   1.  Use DANE for authentication, and treat any endpoints lacking DANE
       support as incompatible.

   2.  Use PKI for authentication, and treat any DANE-only endpoint as
       incompatible.  In this behavior, compatibility with tlsa=disabled
       endpoints is REQUIRED.

   3.  Support both DANE and PKI for authentication, preferring DANE if
       it is available for each endpoint.

   This SvcParamKey MAY be used in any SVCB context where TLSA usage is
   defined.

;; The server is only authenticatable via DANE.  Any resolver that
;; lacks DANE support will treat this record as incompatible.
alpn=doq tlsa="..." mandatory=alpn

;; The server is only authenticatable via DANE, but also offers Do53
;; services.  All resolvers can access it, but only resolvers with
;; DANE support will use DoQ.
alpn=doq tlsa="..."

;; The server is authenticatable via PKI.  If TLSA records exist at
;; the SVCB-DANE owner names, it is also authenticatable via DANE.
;; This record cannot be used to serve the zone containing its TargetName.
alpn=doq

;; The server is only authenticatable via PKI.  Any resolver that
;; lacks PKI validation support will treat this record as incompatible.
alpn=doq tlsa=disabled mandatory=alpn

1.4.  Deployment Considerations

   The DELEG and SVCB records intends to replace the NS record while
   also adding additional functionality in order to support additional
   transports for the DNS.  Below are discussions of considerations for
   deployment.

1.4.1.  Availability

   If a zone operator removes all NS records before DELEG and SVCB
   records are implemented by all clients, the availability of their
   zones will be impacted for the clients that are using non-supporting
   resolvers.  In some cases, this may be a desired quality, but should
   be noted by zone owners and operators.

2.  Privacy Considerations

   All of the information handled or transmitted by this protocol is
   public information published in the DNS.

3.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Fill this section out

3.1.  Resolution procedure

   TODO: Define how resolver selects which server connect to, especially
   when faced with selection of multiple transports.  I's probably
   resolver's policy decision, but it should be said explicitly.

3.1.1.  Connection Failures

   When a resolver attempts to access nameserver delegated by a DELEG or
   SVCB record, if a connection error occurs, such as a certificate
   mismatch or unreachable server, the resolver SHOULD attempt to
   connect to the other nameservers delegated to until either exhausting
   the list or the resolver's policy indicates that they should treat
   the resolution as failed.

   The failure action when failing to resolve a name with DELEG/SVCB due
   to connection errors is dependent on the resolver operators policies.
   For resolvers which strongly favor privacy, the operators may wish to
   return a SERVFAIL when the DELEG/SVCB resolution process completes
   without successfully contacting a delegated nameserver(s) while
   opportunistic privacy resolvers may wish to attempt resolution using
   any NS records that may be present.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  New SvcParamKey Values

   This document defines new SvcParamKey values in the "Service Binding
   (SVCB) Parameter Registry".

           +=============+======+============+=================+
           | SvcParamKey | NAME | Meaning    | Reference       |
           +=============+======+============+=================+
           | TBD1        | tlsa | TLSA RRset | (This Document) |
           +-------------+------+------------+-----------------+
